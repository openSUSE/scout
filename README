The command not found utility was replaced by https://github.com/openSUSE/cnf

Scout is a command line utility which allows users to search in
packages using indexes of various attributes. Many of its data
sources have been discontinued, so currently its most important
use is to print useful messages about packages when a command is
not found in the shell.
This only considers currently active repos.
